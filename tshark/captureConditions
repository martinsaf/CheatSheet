# CAPTURE CONDITION PARAMETERS
  # Purpose
-> Define capture conditions for a singles run/loop. STOP after completing the condition. Also known as "Autostop"
  - Duration: Sniff the traffic and stop after X seconds. Create a new file and write output to it.
  tshark -w test.pcap -a duration:1

  - Filesize: Define the maximum capture file size. Stop after reaching X file size (KB)
  tshark -w test.pcap -a filesize:10

  - Files: Define the maximum number of output files. Stop after X files.
  tshark -w test.pcap -a filesize:10 -a files:3

-> Ring buffer control options. Define capture conditions for multiple runs/loops. (INFINITE LOOP)
  - Duration: Sniff the traffic for X seconds, create a new file and write output to it.
  tshark -w test.pcap -b duration:1

  - Filesize: Define the maximum capture file size. Create a new file and write output to it after reaching filesize X (KB)
  tshark -w test.pcap -b filesize:10

  - Files: Define the maximum number of output files. Rewrite the first/oldest file after creating X files.
  tshark -w test.pcap -b filesize:10 -b files:3

Star sniffing the traffic and stop after 2 seconds, and save the dump into 5 files, each 5kb.
tshark -w autostop-demo.pcap -a duration:2 -a filesize:5 -a files:5
