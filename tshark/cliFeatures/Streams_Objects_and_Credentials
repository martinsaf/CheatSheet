Follow Stream
  Main Parameter
    -z follow
      Protocol: TCP, UDP, HTTP, HTTP2
      View Mode: HEX, ASCII
      Stream Number: 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 ...
      Additional Parameter: -q

NOTE: Streams start from "0". You can filter the packets and follow the streams by using the parameters given below.
  TCP Streams: -z follow,tcp,ascii,0 -q
  UDP Streams: -z follow,udp,ascii,0 -q
  HTTP Streams: -z follow,http,ascii,0 -q

tshark -r demo.pcapng -z follow,tcp,ascii,1 -q

Export Objects
  This option helps analysts to extract files from DICOM, HTTP, IMF, SMB, and TFTP. The query structure is explained next:
  Main Parameter:
    --export-objects
      Protocol: DICOM, HTTP, IMF, SMB, TFTP
      Target Folder: Target folder to save the files
      Additional Parameter: -q
  You can filter the packets and follow the streams by using the parameters given below.

  --export-objects http,/home/ubuntu/Desktop/extracted-by-tshark -q

  Extract the files from HTTP traffic.
    tshark -r demo.pcapng --export.pcapng --export-objects http,/home/ubuntu/Desktop/extracted-by-tshark -q

Credentials
  This option helps analysts to detect and collect cleartext credentials from FTP,HTTP,IMAP,POP and SMTP. You can filter the packets and find the cleartext credentials using the parameters below.
    -z credentials -q

    tshark -r credentials.pcap -z credentials -q

Count the correct lines (jumps 5 lines): tshark -r credentials.pcap -z credentials | nl | tail -n +5
