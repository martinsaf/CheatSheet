USE CASES - EXTRACT INFORMATION
  When investigating a case, a security analyst should know how to extract hostnames, DNS queries, and user agents to hunt low-hanging fruits after viewing the statistics and creating an investigation plan.

  Extract Hostnames
    tshark -r hostnames.pcapng -T fields -e dhcp.option.hostname

  Sometimes output is hard to manage when multiple duplicate values exist. A skilled analyst should know how to use native Linux tools/utilities to manage and organise the command line output.
    thshark -r hostnames.pcapng -T fields -e dhcp.option.hostname | awk NF | sort -r | uniq -c | sort -r

  Now the output is organised and ready to process/use. The logic of the query is explained below.
  Query:
    tshark -r hostnames.pcapng -T fields -e dhcp.option.hostname
      Main query. Extract the DHCP hostname vaue.
    awk NF
      Remove empty lines.
    sort -r
      Sort recursively before handling the values.
    uniq -c
      Show unique values, but calculate and show the number of occurrences.
    sort -r
      The final sort process. Show the output/results from high occurrences to less.

  Extract DNS Queries
    tshark -r dns-queries.pcap -T fields -e dns.qry.name | awk NF | sort -r | uniq -c | sort -r

  Extract User Agents
    tshark -r user-agents.pcap -T fields -e http.user_agent | awk NF | sort -r | uniq -c | sort -r
